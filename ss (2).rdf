Although not quite pressed, the whey has been drained and squeezed out.[18] It is often served as a side dish to soften the effect of very spicy food. It has little to no distinct taste of its own. However, when served separately, ayibe is often mixed with a variety of mild or hot spices typical of Gurage cuisine.</untitled-ontology-5:Description>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>The Tigray region of Ethiopia converted to Christianity in the fourth century and became a very important ally of the Byzantine empire, ruled from Constantinople (Istanbul), in controlling the trade routes to India. Tigray also maintained contacts with other Christian communities of the eastern Mediterranean, including those in Syria and Egypt. The compelling images on this double-sided leaf are from a group of early fourteenth-century Gospels that feature a revival of motifs that reached Ethiopia from the eastern Mediterranean, probably in the seventh century.

Both sides of the leaf are inscribed in Ge&apos;ez, the ancient language of Ethiopia. On the front is a dramatic octagonal Fountain of Life flanked by peacocks, which are identified in the inscriptions as &quot;ostriches&quot; (royal birds in Ethiopia), and gazellelike &quot;babula.&quot; The text within the domed space refers to the arrangement of the Eusebian Canon Tables, or index to the Gospels, which preceded the image in the original manuscript. On the reverse, the Crucifixion is represented by a monumental jeweled cross topped by a Lamb of God, symbol of Christ&apos;s sacrifice. At the sides are the two thieves bound to their crosses. Other leaves from this Gospel are in the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>In the seventeenth century, Ethiopian artists were increasingly exposed to forms of expression from Europe. During this period, double-sided diptychs became popular among the nobility as pendant icons worn suspended by a cord around the neck. The subject matter depicted on this example is a standard program for this genre of personal icon, as are the intricately carved cruciform designs that enhance the exterior surfaces of the protective covers.

This icon is a classic example of the painting style developed during the late seventeenth century at Gondar, the trading center where King Fasiladas (r. 1632–67) established his capital. Portrayed frontally with slightly turned heads and simple, iconic gestures, the figures are superimposed upon neutral backgrounds. Bodies are delineated with thick black outlines, while faces are composed of flat areas of pink and orange. Curving lines and attenuated arcs are employed to evoke the folds of draped robes and mantles.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:Description>The Illuminated Gospel of Ethiopia is a religious manuscript that contains the four gospels of the New Testament written in Ge&apos;ez, an ancient Ethiopian language. The manuscript is also known as the Garima Gospels, after the monk who is said to have written it, and is believed to be one of the oldest surviving illuminated manuscripts in the world.</untitled-ontology-5:Description>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>This illuminated manuscript of the Four Gospels was created at a monastic center in northern Ethiopia. Twenty full-page paintings depict scenes from the life of Christ and four portraits of the evangelists introduce the respective Gospel texts. The New Testament was translated from Greek into Geez, the classical language of Ethiopia, in the sixth century. Both this text and its pictorial format draw upon Byzantine prototypes, which were transformed into a local idiom of expression. Stylistically consistent, the paintings reflect the hands of two distinct artists. The color scheme consists of red, yellow, green, and blue. A stylized uniformity is reflected in the abbreviated definition of facial features and the bold linear articulation of the human form in black and red. Figures&apos; heads are depicted frontally, their bodies often in profile. Bodies are treated as columnar masses encased in textiles composed of striated fields juxtaposed against one another.

This work is evidence of sub-Saharan Africa&apos;s historically complex interrelationships with Arabia, Egypt, and the eastern Mediterranean. The origins of civilization in Highlands Ethiopia can be traced to the sixth century B.C.E., when emigrants from Arabia merged with indigenous groups to develop the kingdom of Aksum. In the fourth century C.E., scholars from Alexandria converted the Ethiopian king Ezana, and Christianity became the official religion of a state that endured until modern times. Over the centuries, as the Ethiopian state expanded, monasteries were founded as centers of learning responsible for disseminating knowledge and consolidating the power and influence of the monarchy. In the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the text of the Gospels was considered the most important holy writing; the miniatures at the beginning of this manuscript were intended to be viewed during liturgical processions. Such works were frequently presented to churches by distinguished patrons; they reflected both the prestige of royal benefactors and the erudition of the monastic scriptoria in which they were created. Recent research suggests that a member of Ethiopia&apos;s ruling elite may have commissioned this manuscript at Dabra Hayg Estifanos monastery for presentation to his or her favored church or monastery. Brief notations indicate that the church in question was dedicated to the Archangel Michael.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>Imbued with symbolic meaning and protective powers, crosses have been used as a sign of Ethiopian Orthodox Christian devotion since at least the fourth century A.D. Individual patrons commissioned crosses such as this example to give to religious institutions as acts of devotion. Here, the central trifoliate cross is amplified by a multiplicity of outwardly projecting pattée crosses that suggest organic luxuriance. The openings are both aesthetic and functional, heightening the object’s intricate silhouette while minimizing its weight. The earliest in the Museum’s collection from the Lasta region, this cross is contemporary with the later rock-hewn churches at Lalibela. Like other crosses and architectural elements typical at that site, this cross exhibits the split palmette motif. The palmette extends from circular joints at its base to form two opposed half-lunettes surrounding a pattée cross at the upper limits and sides of the primary cross. This motif alludes to the cross as the Tree of Life as well as to the divine aureole of Christ borne on the wings of the Four Beasts. The complex configuration relates this cross to a processional cross in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, but here the design is more elegantly attenuated and the execution is crisper and more sharply resolved.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>In one village there was a man and a woman and they had one daughter and her parents ordered the girl to make the cattle drink water around the village. The girl took the cattle to the spring, but it was very disturbed and unclear. She had a problem and didn’t know what to do.

Her father came, and then the demon of the spring came out of the water and said, “If you want your cattle to drink good water you must give me your daughter.”

So the man agreed that later he would give her.

They went home and the father said, “Oh, I have lost one of my shoes in the river. Go and find it by the edge of the water.”

The devil came out and said (a poem):
“You beautiful girl
With long hair and big breasts
I am coming to take you away.”

She began running home. When she got home, the door was closed.

She said, “Oh father, there is one creature who says, ‘With long hair and big breasts’, he is coming towards me! Please open the door!”

But the father refuses to open the door and let her in. She runs to her aunt’s and says the same poem. But she refused to open the door since she was frightened.

She went to her friend’s house. She says the same poem to her best friend. Her friend opens the door.

The friend gave her an edible flower and said, “When you go home, pick the petals one at a time, eat one and throw one. Eat one and throw one.”

And the devil was distracted by the petals.

So she went to her grandmother and started living with them. Finally she became owner of forty dogs and her parents came to visit her and the name of the girl was Almaz.

Her grandmother said, “Almaz, your parents have come to visit you.”

So they came in and Almaz says:
“My father, my mother.
You gave me to a devil.
Bark, my forty dogs.”

So the dogs started barking and bit the parents and ate them.

The aunt also came another time and repeated the same.

&quot;My aunt,
You gave me to a devil.
Bark my forty dogs.&quot;

She, too, was eaten.

Lastly the friend came and when Almaz heard her friend had come she welcomed her.

&quot;My friend, my friend,
The saviour of my life.
Don’t bark my forty dogs.”

(The narrator added this couplet, which is the usual ending to a story in Tigray:)

If you forget this story,
May death forget you.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>Once upon a time, two men were going together on a journey.

One of them said to the other, “I have nothing to eat, so would you give me something if you have it?”

The good man was very generous, so he agreed to share his food, and they went on together. In the middle of the journey the food ran out. But the bad man had his food hidden with him. After the good man’s food was finished he took out his food and began to eat alone.

The good man saw this and begged him to give him some food to eat. The wicked man was so selfish he refused to give him some food and ate alone. So the good man became very hungry and began to beg desperately for food before he died.

But the wicked man said, “If you want some food I’ll have to take out one of your eyes, otherwise you must starve.”

So the good man had no choice and agreed and let the wicked man take one of his eyes.

After a while the good man was hungry again. So he asked the wicked man for some food, but the wicked man refused.

The good man begged desperately again, and the wicked man said, “I’ll have to take out the other eye.”

Since the good man was so hungry he let the wicked man take out his remaining eye. So the wicked man took out the eye and gave him some food.

They went on, and when they reached a city, the wicked man put the good man under a tree and left him and went away. The good man sat alone under the tree till darkness fell. But this tree during the night was used by jinns as a meeting place. So when it got very dark the jinns came to meet and began to discuss and talk among themselves.

When they found the blind man, one of the jinns said, “This tree’s leaves can restore the sight of a person who has lost it.”

The second jinn said, “The daughter of the king has been paralysed and no remedy or cure has yet been found. But if the king slaughters a black dog and washes his daughter in its blood, she will be cured.”

The third jinn said, “The citizens of this city spend the whole day looking for water, but they could find water if they cut down the big tree which is found in the middle of the city.”

So the good man heard all this, sitting quietly, and when daylight came and the jinns went away, he began to grope about and picked a leaf from the tree and rubbed it on his eyes. So his sight was immediately restored.

After that he went into the city and told the people to take him to the king. When he came into the king’s presence he addressed him and told him that he can cure his daughter.

But the king’s counsellors told him that they have tried every means possible to cure her, and every attempt has failed. So it’s useless to try.

But the good man insisted and the king agreed.

So he brought a black dog and killed it and washed the princess with the blood. The princess was cured. So the king was very happy and gave him a reward.

After some days, he saw the citizens searching for the whole day long for water.

He said to the king, “If you assign a few workers to me, I’ll find water for the city.”

So he was given the workers, and he went to the big tree standing in the middle of the city and cut it down with the workers’ help. Then the water came out.

The king was very happy with him and married him to his daughter and gave him a lot of money.

One day the good man met the wicked man. He told him what had happened.

The wicked man was surprised and said, “How could you be so fortunate?”

So the good man told him about the jinns.

So the wicked man thought, “I should go to that tree and spend the night and hear what the jinns say.”

As usual, the jinns came and began their meeting.

One of them stood up and said, “The problems we discussed concerning the city and the king have all been solved. The princess is cured and the water is flowing now. How did this happen? There must be someone here hiding, who is listening to us. Let’s hunt for him.”

So they began to search, and they found the wicked man and killed him.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>Once upon a time, the hyena’s cub died, and there was a big mourning ceremony and everybody sat around mourning so, as it was the custom of the country, the donkeys also decided to go and pay their respects to the dead.

So they went to the place, and they began crying in the customary mode, singing songs and dirges.

And they said, “What has killed your great cub? Who killed it? What has brought such sad things upon you?”

As they cried, the hyenas said, “Well, that’s over now. Now it’s gone. But what have you brought for us to eat?”

So the donkeys said, “Well, according to tradition, we will have to discuss what we are going to give you.”

So all the donkeys got up, and they left the mourning place, and they went and they sat outside.

And they said, “Usually people contribute and give things for the bereaved to eat. But I’m sure the hyenas want to eat us. So what shall we do?”

They said, “All of us must escape, but to fool them we’ll have to send back one of the donkeys and say, &apos;This is what we’ve brought you to eat.&apos; And then we’ll have to whisper to the donkey how she should escape.”

So when they went away, they sent back one donkey, and she went in, and the hyenas saw her and said, “Let’s eat her later.”

And she said, “Okay, I am the gift.”

And after some time she said, “Please let me get up and walk around.”

And the hyenas said, “Okay, but please don’t go too far. And when we want you, how shall we call you?”

And the donkey said, “Oh, that’s no problem, just call out and say, &apos;The previous one, the previous one!&apos; And I will come running back.”

So the hyenas agreed, and she went out.

After some time, the hyenas became hungry and they called out, “The previous one, the previous one! Where have you gone? Come back!”

And she called out from far away, “The previous one has gone and she’s smelling the railings in her stable.”

Now the hyenas became really cross, and they said, “If we get you again we’ll eat you up.”

But the donkey laughed and said, “I’ll never stay out late again.”

And now it is believed that this is why from all the cattle and sheep the donkeys are always the first to return to the stable.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

So the ox did this, and the next day the master came and said, “Oh, my ox is sick, let the donkey take the plough.”

So the donkey, having taken the ox’s job, was so tired. The ox came to him again, happily expecting more advice.

He rested himself beside him and said, “It was such a lovely day yesterday. I will rest today and I won’t go to work tomorrow, either. Tell me how I can persuade the farmer.”

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>Once upon a time a group of men were walking together and they had a sack of wheat and other cereals with them.

And one man said, “I don’t want to go with you. Just give me one small grain of corn and I’ll leave you and go.”

The others said, “What’s wrong with you? Why don’t we do the journey together? We can share the corn and cook our food together and share it. But if you take one grain of corn you’re not going to do anything with it.”

He said, “That’s none of your business. All I want is one grain of corn.”

So the young men discussed among themselves.

“One grain of corn is nothing to us. Let us give it to him.”

So they gave him one grain of corn and he went to a small village and a lady was making some corn meal and he threw his grain into the pot and said, “I’ll be back for dinner.”

She looked up at the stranger with surprise but said nothing.

That evening he waited until dinner time was passed and he came to the house.

All the men had finished eating and they said, “How unfortunate that you came after our meal. Otherwise you could have shared it with us.”

He said yes, he had brought one grain of corn, but when she was grinding the corn it had disappeared somehow and she didn’t know where it was.

The man got very hard and angry and he said, “Either give me my meal or else I want the cooking pot.”

They wondered what a crazy person he was and they said, “Well, you can’t have a meal because we don’t have anything left.”

So they conferred and said, “Well, one cooking pot is nothing for us,” and they gave him the cooking pot.

So he walked away with his clay cooking pot and went to the river and he filled it with water and put it by the roadside. He saw a flock of goats coming and put the pot in their way so obviously they started drinking and as they pushed their heads into the pot they broke it.

So he called the owner of the goats and said, “Look, they’ve broken my pot. Either I want my pot back, or I’ll take one of your goats.”

The man said, “Don’t worry. I’ll give you another pot.”

“No, I want my original pot.”

The man couldn’t do anything because he couldn’t repair the pot, so reluctantly he gave him a goat.

Now the man took the goat and when he saw a herd of camels coming after lunch when camels get a bit excited, he tied the goat on the road so when the herd of camels went by they trampled the goat.

So he stopped the camel driver and said, “Look, you’ve killed my goat. I want you to bring the goat back to life or else you’ve got to give me a camel.”

The man said, “That’s impossible. How can I make a goat come back to life? Let me go and find a goat and give it to you.”

He said, “No. Either my own goat or a camel.”

So, since the goat was dead, the man was forced to give him a camel.

So the man went along with his camel and on the way he met the funeral of his friend.

“Wait a moment,” he said. “I want this man’s body. Exchange it for a camel.”

The people got together and decided that the body was useless, but the camel was valuable, so they exchanged the camel for the body.

It was near evening, so he walked into a small village where people were sitting down and eating and he said, “Hello, we’re travellers and it’s got dark so let my friend spend the night here and I’ll spend the night in the next hut.”

He threw the body into a chair and the people didn’t realise he was dead. As he was walking out again he stabbed the body with a spear and went to the neighbour’s house. And in the Afar culture anyone who comes to eat is invited as a guest. And they gave him dinner.

As he was eating he said, “I heard a cry from the next hut. I left my friend there. Let’s go and see.”

When they went rushing the people next door had just found the body with a spear.

And he started screaming, saying, “They’ve killed my friend.”

So there was a big hue and cry and they decided that the neighbours had killed his friend. He had to be compensated. And the compensation for one man is 100 camels or 400 cattle. So he took half the payment in camels and half in cattle and he became a very rich man.

And he married two wives. From the first wife he had four children and from the second wife he just had one son. Then he lived happily for many years.

Then the man died. And when he died he made a request that his body be taken to the burial ground on the back of a camel. Now as they were taking the camel it suddenly ran away and they didn’t know what to do. He was a very rich and famous man and everybody was waiting for his body to arrive and moreover, if his body wasn’t buried they might have some problems with the inheritance.

So the four children from the first wife said, “Why don’t we kill our brother? We’ll have a body to bury and we’ll also have no problem with the inheritance because we’ll get everything.”

So they killed their brother and they took his body to the burial ground and just as they were burying him the other camel came back with the other body. The body was completely torn to bits and only the head remained on the camel’s back. So the people stopped the camel and when they looked at the head it was of the man they assumed they were burying.

So they said, “Why, this is that man! Who are we burying?”

And when they undid the body they saw it was his son. So now all the family of one of the wives was at war with all the family of the second wife. And the two families wiped each other out.

This shows that when someone does bad things to other people, even though he might succeed, his sins will be carried on to his children.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>The Blue Nile Falls is a waterfall on the Blue Nile river in Ethiopia. It is known as Tis Abay in Amharic, meaning &quot;Smoke Abay&quot;. It is situated on the upper course of the river, about 30 kilometres (19 mi) downstream from the town of Bahir Dar and Lake Tana. The falls are one of Ethiopia&apos;s best-known tourist attractions.

The falls are 42 metres (138 ft) high,consisting of four streams that originally varied from a trickle in the dry season to over 400 meters wide in the rainy season. Regulation of Lake Tana now reduces the variation somewhat, and since 2003 a hydro-electric station has taken much of the flow out of the falls except during the rainy season. The Blue Nile Falls isolate the ecology of Lake Tana from the ecology of the rest of the Nile, and this isolation has played a role in the evolution of the endemic fauna of the lake.

A short distance downstream from the falls sits the first stone bridge constructed in Ethiopia, built at the command of Emperor Susenyos in 1626. According to Manuel de Almeida, stone for making lime had been found nearby along the tributary Alata, and a craftsman who had come from India with Afonso Mendes, the Catholic Patriarch of Ethiopia, supervised the construction.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>Debre Damo (Tigrinya: ??? ??), also spelled Debre Dammo, Dabra D?mmo or Däbrä Dammo), is the name of a flat-topped mountain, or amba, and a 6th-century monastery in Tigray Region of Ethiopia. The mountain is a steeply rising plateau of trapezoidal shape, about 1,000 by 400 m (3,300 by 1,300 ft) in dimension. It sits at an elevation of 2,216 m (7,270 ft) above sea level. It is north of Bizet, and north-west of Adigrat, in the Mehakelegnaw Zone of the Tigray Region, close to the border with Eritrea.

The mountain hosted a monastery, accessible only by rope up a sheer cliff, 15 m (49 ft) high, is known for its collection of manuscripts and for having the earliest existing church building in Ethiopia that is still in its original style, and only men can visit it. Tradition claims that the monastery was founded in the 6th century by Abuna Aregawi.

Part of the monastery was destroyed during the Tigray War, prior to 14 February 2021</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>Sof Omar Caves is the longest cave in Ethiopia at 15.1 kilometres (9.4 mi) long. When surveyed in 1972, it was the longest cave in Africa. Since then explorations in Madagascar (Marosakabe - 113km) and Algeria (Rhar Bou Ma’za - the Tafna River Cave 18.4 km) have overtaken it.  It is situated to the east of Ginnir, in the East Bale Zone of the Oromia Region in southeastern Ethiopia, through which the Weyib River (Gestro River) flows. It sinks at the Ayiew Maco entrance and reappears at the Holuca resurgence 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) away. According to tradition Sof Omar was the name of a Muslim holy man who lived in the area and Ayiew the name of his daughter. Maco and Holuca are local names for &apos;name&apos; and &quot;cave&quot;, respectively. Long a religious centre, it is sacred both to Islam and the local Oromo traditional religion. The caves are known for their many pillars, particularly in the &quot;Chamber of Columns&quot;.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:Name>The_Yemrehanna_Kristos_Church</untitled-ontology-5:Name>
        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>The church of Yemrehanna Kristos is one of Ethiopia&apos;s best-preserved late Axumite churches, and is named for a twelfth-century Zagwe priest-king and saint. It is set in a spectacular landscape of juniper trees located inside a large natural cavern on a hill in northern Ethiopia, predating the famous nearby rock-hewn churches of Lalibela by almost a century. The walls of the building were constructed with alternating layers of recessed timber beams and projecting plastered stone, and the windows are covered by carved cruciform lattices. The interior is divided into a nave and two side aisles by masonry pillars and arches, with a domed sanctuary on the east end. All interior wood surfaces, including the paneled ceilings, are elaborately decorated with carved geometric designs and polychrome. The walls are painted with polychrome murals depicting scenes from the Bible. Priests and hermits still live at Yemrehanna Kristos, and the church is a place of pilgrimage. Over the centuries many pilgrims came to the church to die, and their remains are buried behind the structure.

Yemrehanna Kristos was included on the 2014 World Monuments Watch to raise awareness of this extraordinary site and its importance. The building has generally been well-preserved, but evidence of structural cracks noticed around the time of the Watch announcement led to a thorough assessment of the site.

A timely grant for the church’s preservation
In the fall of 2015, we received a grant from the U.S. State Department Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP) in order to carry out a project at the church. The project began in February 2016 with an official ceremony led by His Holiness Abune Mathias, and in the same month stakeholders from the Church, the government, and the local community met to discuss their goals for the initiative. The project will run for 18 months and include the creation of a conservation management plan and a model of the church. In March 2016 a team carried out detailed analysis of the building, using laser scanning technology and movement monitors in order to determine the causes of its structural instability. As the project progresses we will join forces with the Ethiopian Heritage Fund to undertake conservation work on wall paintings inside the church, which many scholars believe to be the oldest surviving wall paintings in Ethiopia. A new access road will also lead to the site from the popular destination of Lalibela, which will increase visitation numbers and prompt the consideration of new management issues.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>This is the only known icon devoted to the genealogy of a monastic order. Its subject is the &quot;House of Ewost&apos; atéwos,&quot; one of two major monastic orders of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Born circa 1273, St. Ewost&apos; atéwos founded a number of monasteries in northern Ethiopia. Doctrinal disputes led to his exile in Egypt and Armenia, where he died around 1352. In this visual genealogy of the Ewost&apos; atéwos house, he is heralded at the summit of the central panel as a revered visionary surrounded by his followers. In his left hand is a prayer staff carried by traveling monastics, and in his right are a censor and cross wielded for blessing. The inscription directly above identifies him as &quot;revered teacher of religion in Ethiopia and Armenia.&quot; Eight diminutive disciples are depicted in his image to underscore their devotion and allegiance. Each is identified by name and distinguished by the vibrant, swirling colored patterns of their robes. Given this work&apos;s considerable scale and imagery, it was likely the property of a monastery whose historical ties to neighboring communities it recorded. A panel painting was regarded as the spiritual embodiment of the saint portrayed.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>This intimately-scaled illuminated manuscript is a luxury example of the Arganonä Maryam (The Organ of Mary), one of the most popular Ethiopian Orthodox prayer books dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It is one of ten works credited to the late-seventeenth century scribe Baselyos. These share a distinctive style of bold, linear, geometric graphic ornamentation. This manuscript features four distinct kinds of ornaments: full-page illuminations; interlaced borders (haräg); magical images; and textual ornament, including punctuation marks and headers. The images throughout the 150-folio text are rendered in a reduced color palette of black, ochre, red, and white. Crisp black lines divide flat planes of pigment into cross and triangle shapes, motifs repeated throughout the manuscript. These vivid color fields are juxtaposed with fine lines evoking woven texture. Non-illuminated pages are filled by text containing prayers to the Virgin Mary.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>Once upon a time the jackal, the fox and the rabbit used to live together. They were great friends and they formed a good trio. But obviously, because the jackal and the fox were carnivores, and the rabbit was a herbivore, they were different essentially in nature. So the jackal and the fox tended to get along better, but they liked the rabbit nevertheless because he was so fast and quick in doing everything.

But as time went on, the more the fox and the jackal saw the rabbit, the more they wanted to eat him. They thought he was supple and succulent and they discussed this.

And they said, “Look, we could tear him apart. You grab one of his legs and I’ll grab the other legs and we’ll just rip him apart and eat him. He’s so small, he wouldn’t make us a good lunch, but he could make a snack or breakfast or something.”

So they decided to eat the rabbit when he came back.

However the rabbit was very smart, and when he came back he was suspicious of the jackal grinding his teeth, so he kept his distance from them, and he said, “What&apos;s wrong with you all?”

And they said, “Nothing, nothing, everything’s all right.”

So the rabbit started keeping his distance so they couldn’t catch him.

Now the fox and the jackal were a bit angry about this, so they said, “Since now he doesn’t come close to us like before, we’ve got to decide how to trick him.”

So they discussed this for some time and they came up with a plan. They said the jackal should go over to his house and lie down as if he was terribly sick, and the fox would send the rabbit over to visit. Then when the rabbit came to visit him, the jackal could easily catch him.

So, as he was told, the jackal went to his house, closed his eyes, and kept his mouth closed, and kept on peeking out from one of his eyes to see when the rabbit had come.

The fox on the other hand, went and waited for the rabbit to come to the field, and said, “Hey there Rabbit, have you heard the news?”

“No, what happened?” the rabbit asked.

“Well, our friend the jackal is seriously sick. In fact I think he’s going to die. I think you’d better go and visit him very soon, otherwise you’ll have regrets of not having visited him before he died, so I think it’s a good idea that you go, and you check and visit him before he passes away.”

“Oh, that’s a good idea.” said the rabbit suspiciously, and she set off on her path to the jackal’s house.

Now the jackal was peeping out through his eyes and his eyelids were quivering. So the rabbit came not very near, and she propped up her ears and she couldn’t hear anything. So she looked and she could see that the jackal was peeping through one eye and his lips were tightly closed.

Now the rabbit didn’t know how to get away, so she thought a bit and she said, “Oh my God, this jackal doesn’t look dead at all. When jackals die they keep their eyes shut fast and they open their mouth.”

So on hearing this, the jackal tightly shut his eyes, and gently opened his mouth. Now, because his eyes were closed, the rabbit ran away, without him seeing. So after a few minutes, the fox decided that the jackal must have killed the rabbit by now, and he decided to go over to share the meal. But when he went over, the jackal was all alone and angry, banging himself against his bed, and when the fox asked, “What’s wrong?” he said, “The rabbit ran away.”

Ever since that day the friendship of the three was no longer, and the jackal and the fox run after the rabbit and try to catch him and kill him whenever they can.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:Description>Tej is a potent honey wine. It is similar to mead, and is frequently served in bars, particularly in a tej bet or &quot;tej house&quot;.
It is prepared from honey and gesho. It has a sweet taste and the alcoholic content is relatively higher than tella. This drink can be stored for a long time; the longer it is stored, the higher the alcohol content, and the stronger the taste.</untitled-ontology-5:Description>

        <untitled-ontology-5:Description>The ruins of the ancient city of Aksum are found close to Ethiopia&apos;s northern border. They mark the location of the heart of ancient Ethiopia, when the Kingdom of Aksum was the most powerful state between the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia. The massive ruins, dating from between the 1st and the 13th century A.D., include monolithic obelisks, giant stelae, royal tombs and the ruins of ancient castles. Long after its political decline in the 10th century, Ethiopian emperors continued to be crowned in Aksum.</untitled-ontology-5:Description>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>{&quot;Brief synthesis&quot;: null, &quot;Authenticity&quot;: &quot;The authenticity of the obelisks, tombs and other monuments remain intact, although they are vulnerable due to lack of conservation. However, the authenticity of the whole property in terms of its ability to convey the scope and extent of ancient Aksum and its value is still vulnerable to lack of documentation, delineation and lack of planning controls. The monuments need to be related to the overall city plan, in spatial terms.\nProtection and Management Requirements\nThe city of Aksum was put under the jurisdiction and protection of the National Antiquities Authority in 1958. No special legal framework is provided to protect the Obelisks of Aksum, except the general law, Proclamation No. 209/2000, which also established the institution in charge, the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage (ARCCH).\nThe property is managed at three levels \u2013 the site; the region; and the Federal administration. ARCCH prepared a proclamation that mapped and identified the precise area to be protected with local site authorities. It is reviewing the components and may wish to suggest changes to the number and/or size of the property.\nThe boundary and the property\u2019s management plan are not yet established. There is a need to submit an up-dated map of the property to clearly indicate the boundary, to produce and submit a management plan and to delineate and submit a buffer zone. There is also a need for adequate legal protection to be put in place.&quot;, &quot;Integrity&quot;: &quot;The boundaries of the property, which encompass the entire area of ancient Aksum town, need to be adequately delineated and approved by the Committee.\nOne obelisk, removed from the site and taken to Rome as a war trophy during the Italian occupation, was returned to Aksum in 2005 and re-erected in in 2008.\nFurthermore, at the time of inscription, it was noted that small, modern houses were built over most of the site, obscuring the majority of the underground Aksumite structures. Some of them still remain covered by modern houses. In 2011, the construction of a new museum began in the main Stelae Field and, unless amended, the height of the museum will have a highly negative visual impact on the property. Flooding has also become a major problem in the 4th century AD Tomb of the Brick Arches and other monuments.\u00a0\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the integrity of the property remains vulnerable.&quot;, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: null}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

Hundreds of thousands of people from diverse communities flock to the square as colourfully dressed priests chant hymns and prayers and perform their unique rhythmic dance in front of the pyre. At the climax, the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church lights the bonfire. Maskel is celebrated nationwide regardless of age, gender, language or ethnicity. Participants are believed to receive spiritual rewards from the celebration and blessings from the Holy Cross. Local churches play a key role in coordinating communities and safeguarding the element. The festival is also a time when families get together and migrant workers return home – reunions that result in the inflow of money, information and new ideas from urban centres to rural areas. Prior to the celebration, personal quarrels and social disagreements must be resolved. In this way, Maskel is an occasion for Ethiopians to promote their spiritual life through reconciliation, social cohesion and peaceful coexistence.&quot;, &quot;Authenticity&quot;: null, &quot;Integrity&quot;: null, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: null}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>Haile Selassie I, original name Tafari Makonnen, (born July 23, 1892, near Harer, Ethiopia—died August 27, 1975, Addis Ababa), emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974 who sought to modernize his country and who steered it into the mainstream of post-World War II African politics. He brought Ethiopia into the League of Nations and the United Nations and made Addis Ababa the major centre for the Organization of African Unity (now African Union).
Tafari was a great-grandson of Sahle Selassie of Shewa (Shoa) and a son of Ras (Prince) Makonnen, a chief adviser to Emperor Menilek II. Educated at home by French missionaries, Tafari at an early age favourably impressed the emperor with his intellectual abilities and was promoted accordingly. As governor of Sidamo and then of Harer province, he followed progressive policies, seeking to break the feudal power of the local nobility by increasing the authority of the central government—for example, by developing a salaried civil service. He thereby came to represent politically progressive elements of the population. In 1911 he married Wayzaro Menen, a great-granddaughter of Menilek II.
When Menilek II died in 1913, his grandson Lij Yasu succeeded to the throne, but the latter’s unreliability and his close association with Islam made him unpopular with the majority Christian population of Ethiopia. Tafari became the rallying point of the Christian resistance, and he deposed Lij Yasu in 1916. Zauditu, Menilek II’s daughter, thereupon became empress in 1917, and Ras Tafari was named regent and heir apparent to the throne.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

The eve is known as Ketera, which means blocking the flow of water for the blessing of the celebrants. On the eve of Ketera, people escort their parish church tabot (replicas of the Ark of the Covenant) to Timkete-Bahir (a pool, river or artificial reservoir), transported by a priest of the parish and accompanied by a great ceremony. The people spend the night attending night-long prayers and hymn services, including the Eucharistic Liturgy. Hundreds of thousands participate in the actual festival on the following day – 19 January. The celebration starts early in the morning with pre-sunrise rituals. These are followed by the sprinkling of the blessed water on the congregation, as well as other ceremonies. At around 10 a.m., each tabot begins its procession back to its respective church, involving an even more colourful ceremony with various traditional and religious songs. The viability of the element is ensured through its continued practice, with Orthodox clergies playing a pivotal role: they sing the praises dedicated to the rituals and hymns, carry the Ark, and preach relevant texts.&quot;,&quot;Authenticity&quot;: null, &quot;Integrity&quot;: null, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: null}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

It constitutes a spectacular example of a living cultural tradition stretching back 21 generations (more than 400 years) adapted to its dry hostile environment. The landscape demonstrates the shared values, social cohesion and engineering knowledge of its communities. The site also features anthropomorphic wooden statues - grouped to represent respected members of their communities and particularly heroic events - which are an exceptional living testimony to funerary traditions that are on the verge of disappearing. Stone steles in the towns express a complex system of marking the passing of generations of leaders.</untitled-ontology-5:Description>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>{&quot;Brief synthesis&quot;: null, &quot;Authenticity&quot;: &quot;The Konso Cultural Landscape still largely retains its original form and design. The materials used for the construction of the terraces and the town walls are original and their conservation continues following traditional practices, executed by the community members. The terraces continue in their original arrangements, use and function. The walled towns are still inhabited by the communities and remain organized following the traditional system. The traditionally protected forests are still protected and used for ritual and burial and the water reservoirs remain in use and are periodically conserved. Associated traditions, which continue shaping the landscape, such as the ritual erection of generation and man-hood stones and generation trees continues to be actively practiced. The same applies for the use of the moras and the erection of wakas on the graves. The communities nurture the traditional code of respect to the culture and adherence to the age group (hela) and the ward (kanta), which is responsible for the protection and conservation of the attributes and continues the traditional guardianship.&quot;, &quot;Integrity&quot;: &quot;The boundaries of the Konso Cultural Landscape coincide with natural features, like rivers or edges of densely terraced landscape, and are demarcated by the cultural and socio-economic history of the Konso people. All components relevant to the understanding of the traditional system have been included, such as the key tangible attributes of terraces, walled settlements, sacred forests, shrines and burial sites. The clear distinctive character of the landscape is vulnerable to dispersal of the fortified settlements, in case houses are built outside the town walls.&quot;, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: &quot;The property is protected by traditional, regional and federal laws. The regional \u2018Proclamation to provide for the protection of Konso Cultural Landscape Heritage\u2019 (2010) gives protection to the nominated area including the 12 walled towns and endorses the traditional management system. The traditional code of management is practiced side by side with the modern administrative system and elected community members and elders ensure the protection and management of the cultural properties. In addition, management committees are formed at different levels \u2013 community and district \u2013 and a Konso Cultural Landscape Management Office with governmental personnel has been established on-site, to address primarily planning, funding, supervision and conservation tasks. Development is strictly regulated in the 2010 proclamation and no development may occur within 50 meters of the outermost walls of the fortified towns.\nA management plan sets out in detail the current management structures and explains how the Konso community, through its recognized village committees and the district management committee, will endeavour to ensure the necessary standards of conservation. Presentation and visitor management strategies could yet be better addressed by the community to be of more benefit to the community itself. Supportive funds, including through international cooperation, could contribute to the long-term viability of the traditional management system.&quot;}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>{&quot;Brief synthesis&quot;: &quot;The Lower Awash Valley paleo-anthropological site is located 300 km northeast of Addis Ababa, in the west of the Afar Depression. It covers an area of around 150 km2.\nThe Awash Valley contains one of the most important groupings of paleontological sites on the African continent. The remains found at the property, the oldest of which date back over 4 million years, provide evidence of human evolution, which has modified our conception of the history of humankind. The most spectacular discovery came in 1974, when 52 fragments of a skeleton enabled the famous Lucy to be reconstructed.\nExcavations by an international team of palaeontologists and pre-historians began in 1973, and continued annually until 1976, and ended in 1980. In that time, they found a large quantity of fossilised hominid and animal bones in a remarkable state of preservation, the most ancient of which were at least four million years old. In 1974, the valley produced the most complete set of remains of a hominid skeleton, Australopithecus afarensis, nicknamed \u2018Lucy\u2019, dating back 3.2 million years. Afarensis has since been proved to be the ancestral origin for both the Genus Australopithecus and Homo-sapiens.\nA recovered female skeleton nicknamed \u2018Ardi\u2019 is 4.4 million years old, some 1.2 million years older than the skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis \u2018Lucy\u2019.\nThere is a wealth of paleo-anthropological and pre-historic tools still awaiting discovery and scientific study and these are seen as constituting an exceptionally important cultural heritage resource.\nCriterion (ii): The evidence of hominid and animal fossil remains discovered in the Lower Awash Valley testify to developments in human evolution that have modified views of the history of mankind as a whole.\nCriterion (iii): The excavated paleo-anthropological remains from the Lower Awash Valley dating back almost 4 million years are of exceptional antiquity.\nCriterion (iv): The human vestiges that have been excavated dating back over 3 million years provide an exceptional record that contributes to an understanding of human development.&quot;, &quot;Authenticity&quot;: &quot;The material authenticity is explicit in the finds themselves. However, due to the nature of the site, it is necessary to hold the unearthed finds in the National Museum. The authenticity of the immediate settings of the finds remains largely intact as a result of its desert location, but is vulnerable to fossil hunters. In order to manifest the complete storey of the finds from this valley, it is necessary to go beyond the current boundaries. Better information on the property is still needed.&quot;, &quot;Integrity&quot;: &quot;The boundaries of the sites have yet to be defined. The most extensive remains assigned were found in Hadar, one of the localities within the Lower Awash Valley, but the rest of the valley is seen to have the potential to contribute to further paleontological and historical evidence.\nFurthermore, the Middle Awash Valley has been the focus of intensive research since 1981 and it is the entire valley that is now seen to constitute one of the most important paleontological and pre-historical sites in the world. The boundaries of the property need to be defined to encompass all the attributes related to known and potential archaeological evidence. A buffer zone needs to be provided for the property.\nIn spite of its remote location in the Afar Depression, the property is reportedly the target of individual tourists hunting fossil souvenirs and is thus highly vulnerable.&quot;, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: &quot;An open site, it is naturally protected by the difficult terrain and by the local Afar population. No special legal framework is provided to protect the Lower Awash Valley, except the general law, Proclamation No. 209/2000. This also established the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage as the institution in charge.\nThe site has no local management, and is overseen from the Afar Regional Office in Asayta, 160 km away.\nA museum has been a long-standing aim of the local authorities. One of the principal American research institutions was prepared to build it in 2004, but how it was to be staffed was not resolved.\nThrough the Africa 2009 programme, some expertise in training, in conservation and management was provided at a regional level. Pastoral nomads live around the property, and it has been considered that protection might be improved by involving nomadic tribal chiefs in an oversight of the large area.\nThere is an urgent need to re-assess and define the boundaries so as to encompass all the attributes of Outstanding Universal Value, to define a buffer zone, to put in place local protection, perhaps through the local communities, and to prepare an overall management plan that sets out how protection, management and interpretation will be met in the medium and long term.&quot;}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>{&quot;Brief synthesis&quot;: &quot;The Lower Valley of the Omo is located in south-western Ethiopia. It extends over an area of 165 km2. The age old sedimentary deposits in the Lower Omo Valley are now world renowned for the discovery of many hominid fossils, that have been of fundamental importance in the study of human evolution.\nThe Lower Omo Valley includes the Konso and Fejej paleontological research locations with sedimentary deposit going back to the plio-pleistocene period. These have produced numerous hominid and animal fossils, including fragments of Australopithecus. The deposits of human vertebrae fauna, and paleo-environmental evolution, shed light on the earliest stages of the origins and development of Homo sapiens of Africa. The discoveries of ancient stone tools in an encampment also offers evidence of the oldest known technical activities of prehistoric beings, thus making the property one of the most significant for mankind.\nTo ensure Omo\u2019s position as the yardstick against which all other ancient deposits in East Africa are measured, researched evidence from the site has established bio-stratigraphical, radiometric and magneto-stratigraphical scales spanning between one and 3.5 million years.\nSince 1966, scientific research has proved that the site significantly contributes to prominent archaeological, geological, paleo-anthropological and paleo-environmental studies.\nCriterion (iii): Evidence from the Lower Omo Valley pre-historic and paleo-anthropological site have provided a unique insight into the oldest known technical activities by pre-historic beings.\nCriterion (iv): Discoveries from the Lower Omo Valley represent exceptional developments in the domain of cultural activities in the pre-historic time.&quot;, &quot;Authenticity&quot;: &quot;The sites where discoveries were made remain intact, as does their context. Overall the areas that might provide further evidence of early man are undisturbed.&quot;, &quot;Integrity&quot;: &quot;The boundaries of the property are not adequately defined and such definition needs to be undertaken to ensure all the sites that might contribute to its Outstanding Universal Value are included. Its wider context and setting also need to be established and protected.\nDue to its very remote location, the Omo Valley is a site that is uniquely preserved for scientific research purposes. Although no development activities are foreseen in the near future, it is vulnerable to the work of petroleum companies and other plantation operating around the site, and has been at risk from pillage.&quot;, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: &quot;The property was placed under the protection of the Administration of Antiquities in 1969 through the National Law of 1968.\nNo special legal framework is provided to protect the Lower Omo Valley, except for the general law, Proclamation No. 209/2000, which established the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage as the institute in charge. Currently the zonal and regional Information and Culture Departments perform the management functions.\nA management plan has not yet been established and, due to the extreme geographical difficulties involved, no attempt has yet been made to define the boundary of the property or its buffer zone.\nRecently the protection of the property has become a concern as there have emerged development activities around the area. There is therefore an urgent need to put in place structured management and to define the boundaries.\nInternational research expeditions are still working at the property, as an extension of the research activities started in 1976. It was recommended in 1996 that a survey should be carried out on the present state of the deposits to record any changes brought about by erosion and this still needs to be undertaken.\nThere are an unknown number of nomads living around the Omo Valley who sometimes cross the property, raising the concern of possible occasional damage. A new bridge is scheduled to be constructed in the near future, 104 km from the valley, and this will bring both benefits and threats to the property that will need to be managed.&quot;}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:Description>Massive erosion over the years on the Ethiopian plateau has created one of the most spectacular landscapes in the world, with jagged mountain peaks, deep valleys and sharp precipices dropping some 1,500 m.

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>{&quot;Brief synthesis&quot;: &quot;Simien National Park, in northern Ethiopia is a spectacular landscape, where massive erosion over millions of years has created jagged mountain peaks, deep valleys and sharp precipices dropping some 1,500 m. The park is of global significance for biodiversity conservation because it is home to globally threatened species, including the iconic Walia ibex, a wild mountain goat found nowhere else in the world, the Gelada baboon and the Ethiopian wolf.\nCriterion (vii): The property\u2019s spectacular landscape is part of the Simien mountain massif, which is located on the northern limit of the main Ethiopian plateau and includes the highest point in Ethiopia, Ras Dejen. The undulating plateau of the Simien mountains has over millions of years been eroded to form precipitous cliffs and deep gorges of exceptional natural beauty. Some cliffs reach 1,500 m in height and the northern cliff wall extends for some 35 km. The mountains are bounded by deep valleys to the north, east and south, and offer vast vistas over the rugged-canyon like lowlands below. The spectacular scenery of the Simien mountains is considered to rival the Grand Canyon (USA).\nCriterion (x): The property is of global significance for biodiversity conservation. It forms part of the Afroalpine Centre of Plant Diversity and the Eastern Afromontane biodiversity hotspot, and it is home to a number of globally threatened species. The cliff areas of the park are the main habitat of the Endangered Walia ibex (Capra walie), a wild mountain goat which is endemic to the Simien Mountains. Other flagship species include the Endangered Ethiopian wolf (or Simien fox, Canis simensis), considered to be the rarest canid species in the world and the Gelada baboon (Theropithecus gelada), both of which are endemic to the Ethiopian highlands and depend on Afroalpine grasslands and heathlands. Other large mammal species include the Anubis baboon, Hamadryas baboon, klipspringer, and golden jackal. The park is also an Important Bird Area that forms part of the larger Endemic Bird Area of the Central Ethiopian Highlands. In total, over 20 large mammal species and over 130 bird species occur in the park. The mountains are home to 5 small mammal species and 16 bird species endemic to Eritrea and/or Ethiopia as well as an important population of the rare lammergeyer, a spectacular vulture species. The park\u2019s richness in species and habitats is a result of its great altitudinal, topographic and climatic diversity, which have shaped its Afromontane and Afroalpine ecosystems.&quot;, &quot;Authenticity&quot;: null, &quot;Integrity&quot;: &quot;The property was established in an area inhabited by humans and, at the time of inscription, 80% of the park was under human use of one form or another. Threats to the integrity of the park include human settlement, cultivation and soil erosion, particularly around the village of Gich; frequent fires in the tree heather forest; and excessive numbers of domestic stock. Agricultural and pastoral activities, including both cultivation of a significant area of the property and grazing of a large population of animals in particular have severely affected the natural values of the property, including the critical habitats of the Walia ibex and Ethiopian wolf. The boundaries of the property include key areas essential for maintaining the scenic values of the property. However, they do not encompass all the areas necessary to maintain and enhance the populations of the Walia ibex and Ethiopian wolf, and a proposal to revise and extend the park boundaries was put forward in the original nomination. Whilst human settlements threaten the integrity of the originally inscribed property, two proposed extensions of the national park (the Masarerya and the Limalimo Wildlife Reserves, and also the Ras Dejen mountain and Silki-Kidis Yared sectors) and their interlinking corridors are free of human settlement and cultivation, and support the key species that are central parts of the Outstanding Universal Value of the property. Several assessments have considered that an extension of the property to match extended boundaries of the National Park, which to include areas with negligible human population are an essential requirement to maintain its Outstanding Universal Value.\nProtection and management requirements\nThe national park was established in 1969 and is recognised and protected under national protected areas legislation. The property requires an effective management presence and the maintenance and increasing of staff levels and training . Key tasks for the management of the park include the effective protection of the park\u2019s flagship species and close cooperation with local communities in order to reduce the pressure on the park\u2019s resources arising from agricultural expansion, livestock overstocking and overharvesting of natural resources. The pressures on the property are likely to increase further as a result of global climate change.\nSignificant financial support is needed for the management of the park, and the development of alternative livelihood options for local communities. The development, implementation, review and monitoring of a management plan and the revision and extension of the park boundaries, with the full participation of local communities, is essential. Community partnership is particularly important to both reduce community dependence on unsustainable use of the resources of the national park, and also to develop sustainable livelihoods. Adequate finance to support resettlement of populations living in the property, on a fully voluntary basis, and to introduce effective management of grazing is also essential to reduce the extreme pressure on wildlife. Improving and increasing ecotourism facilities, without impairing the park\u2019s natural and scenic values, has great potential to create additional revenue for the property. Environmental education and training programmes are also needed to support communities in and around the property as well as to maintain community support and partnership in the management of the property in order to ensure it remains of Outstanding Universal Value.&quot;, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: &quot;The national park was established in 1969 and is recognised and protected under national protected areas legislation.

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>Tsegaye earned a degree (1959) from the Blackstone School of Law in Chicago. His interests soon turned to drama, however, and he studied stagecraft at the Royal Court Theatre in London and at the Comédie-Française in Paris. After returning to Ethiopia, he served as director of the Haile Selassie I Theatre (now the National Theatre) from 1961 to 1971. He later founded Addis Ababa University’s theatre department.
Tsegaye wrote more than 30 plays, most of them in Amharic, and translated a number of plays of William Shakespeare and Molière into that language as well. His Amharic plays deal primarily with contemporary Ethiopia, especially with the plight of youth in urban settings and the need to respect traditional morality, as in Crown of Thorns (1959). Oda Oak Oracle (1965) is Tsegaye’s best-known verse play written in English. Like his other English plays, it is based on Ethiopian history and focuses on religious conflict. Collision of Altars (1977) is an experimental play that includes mime, incantation, dance, and the use of masks.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>{&quot;Brief synthesis&quot;: &quot;This is a tower built in the Sabaean style, and dated through comparison with ancient structures in South Arabia to around 700 BC. Although no radiocarbon dating testing has been performed on samples from site, this date for the Great Tower is supported by local inscriptions. David Phillipson attributes its &quot;excellent preservation&quot; to two factors, &quot;the care with which its original builders ensured a level foundation, firmly placed on the uneven bedrock; and to its rededication -- perhaps as early as the sixth century AD -- for use as a Christian church.&quot; Two other archaeological sites at Yeha include Grat Beal Gebri, a ruined complex distinguished by a portico 10 meters wide and two sets of square pillars, and a graveyard containing several rock-hewn shaft tombs first investigated in the early 1960s. One authority has speculated that one of these tombs contained a royal burial, while another believes the ancient residential area was likely one kilometer to the east of the modern village.Ancient stone slabs with Sabaean inscriptions found at Yeha. Additionally, Yeha is the location of an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church monastery. The edifice was founded according to tradition by Abba Aftse, one of the Nine Saints. In his account of Ethiopia, Francisco Álvares mentions visiting this town in 1520 (which he called &quot;Abbafaçem&quot;), and provides a description of the ancient tower, the monastery, and the local church. This church was either the rededicated Great Temple, or a now destroyed building which the Deutsche Aksum-Expedition described in the early 20th century. The current structure, which exhibits Aksumite architectural features, was built between 1948 and 1949. The Central Statistical Agency has not published an estimate for this village&apos;s 2005 population. Explored briefly in February 1893 by the British antiquarian Theodore Bent and his wife Mabel, Yeha has also been the site of a number of archaeological excavations, beginning in 1952 by the Ethiopian Institute of Archeology. Although interrupted during the Derg regime, excavations were resumed in 1993 by a French archaeological team.&quot;,&quot;Authenticity&quot;: null, &quot;Integrity&quot;: null, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: null}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>The Zagwe Period is a period of Ethiopian history marked by the rise of the Zagwe Dynasty, which emerged in the 10th century AD and ruled over Ethiopia for several centuries. The Zagwe Dynasty is known for its unique architectural style, including the construction of rock-hewn churches in the region of Lalibela. The period saw significant cultural and religious developments, with the spread of Christianity and the emergence of new religious practices and traditions. The Zagwe Period lasted until the 13th century AD, when it was supplanted by the Solomonic Dynasty.</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>{&quot;Brief synthesis&quot;: null, &quot;Authenticity&quot;: &quot;Most of the monuments have preserved their authenticity and remain in an overall good state of conservation. But, inappropriate conservation interventions, carried out between 1930 and 1936, using cement and reinforced concrete caused damage to the original materials and impacted the authenticity of the intervened components. The situation was partially reversed with the restoration works carried out by UNESCO in the 1970s, which replaced the cement and concrete work with the original mixes of lime mortar as well as with subsequent major conservation programmes implemented since 1990. Currently conservation activities at the property seek to reverse the prior impacts so as to maintain the authenticity of the property and focus on the use of original techniques and materials. To prevent future impacts, on the authenticity of the component parts of the property, guidelines and interventions for historic buildings need to be defined and enforced through a sustained conservation and maintenance action plan.\nProtection and Management Requirements \nEthiopian Law 1958 (EC) \u2018Antiquities Administration\u2019 provides the national legislative background for the protection and preservation of the Ethiopian cultural heritage. No special legal framework is provided to protect Fasil Ghebbi and the other component parts of the property, except the general law, Proclamation No. 209/2000, the revised proclamation for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage which also establishes ARCCH as the institution in charge.\nARCCH and the Regional and Zonal Culture, Tourism and Information Bureaus are responsible for the management. Monuments that are used for religious services are under the direct responsibility of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. Consequently, the management of the property falls at all the three levels - the property, the region, and the central administration, although the day-to-day management is the responsibility of the property at the local level. The Amhara National Regional State is responsible for the recurrent budget that goes to salaries and regular expenditures. The ARCCH is responsible for capital budget that goes for development works such as restoration and preservations. Additional sources of income are derived from tourist fees and these go to Government treasury and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.\nIn spite of the existence of these arrangements, a more efficient decision-making structure is needed, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities at the national, regional and local levels, as well as with established mechanisms to promote the engagement of stakeholders in the definition and implementation of actions geared toward the management, conservation, protection and use of the component parts of the property. The revised structure needs to be fully supported by legal provisions to ensure adequate financial and human resources for its efficient and sustained operation, including considerations for multilateral and bilateral cooperation projects.\nThe management system needs to be clearly set out in an appropriate Management Plan for the serial property, including the definition of policies to bring about the integrated sustainable development and adequate use of the property. The Management Plan needs to be articulated with other planning tools, such as Gondar\u2019s Master Plan, to ensure the conservation of the attributes that sustain the Outstanding Universal Value of the property. Integrated annual plans need also to be implemented in a sustained manner to address the pending needs for inventory, archaeological research, conservation, restoration and interpretation.&quot;, &quot;Integrity&quot;: &quot;The maps for all the components of the serial property have yet to be prepared and boundaries for the property and buffer zones remain to be delineated. However, several of the component sites, including Fasil Ghebbi, are walled and these provide natural boundaries. These enclosed sites retain all the important attributes that substantiate the Outstanding Universal Value of the property.\nAlthough there are general decay conditions, related to both natural and cultural factors, including lack of maintenance and inadequate past interventions, the components of the property still maintain the necessary conditions of integrity.\nA sustained programme for conservation and maintenance is still needed to improve conditions at the overall property and prevent further erosion of the integrity of the property. Additionally, means to address the existing conflicts to balance the conservation of the historic value of the property with the need to improve the traditional liturgical functions have yet to be implemented. Definition and enforcement of regulatory measures for the management of the buffer zones are also needed to preserve the settings of the component parts of the property.&quot;, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: null}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>{&quot;Brief synthesis&quot;: &quot;Fichee-Chambalaalla is a New Year festival celebrated among the Sidama people. According to the oral tradition, Fichee commemorates a Sidama woman who visited her parents and relatives once a year after her marriage, bringing buurisame, a meal prepared from false banana, milk and butter, which was shared with neighbours. Fichee has since become a unifying symbol of the Sidama people. Each year, astrologers determine the correct date for the festival, which is then announced to the clans. Communal events take place throughout the festival, including traditional songs and dances. Every member participates irrespective of age, gender and social status. On the first day, children go from house to house to greet their neighbours, who serve them buurisame. During the festival, clan leaders advise the Sidama people to work hard, respect and support the elders, and abstain from cutting down indigenous trees, begging, indolence, false testimony and theft. The festival therefore enhances equity, good governance, social cohesion, peaceful co-existence and integration among Sidama clans and the diverse ethnic groups in Ethiopia. Parents transmit the tradition to their children orally and through participation in events during the celebration. Women in particular, transfer knowledge and skills associated with hairdressing and preparation of buurisame to their daughters and other girls in their respective villages.&quot;, &quot;Authenticity&quot;: null, &quot;Integrity&quot;: null, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: null}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

The classes are taught by oral historians covering history, laws, rituals, time reckoning, cosmology, myths, rules of conduct, and the function of the Gada system. Meetings and ceremonies take place under a sycamore tree (considered the Gada symbol) while major clans have established Gada centres and ceremonial spaces according to territory.

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>{&quot;Brief synthesis&quot;: &quot;The fortified historic town of Harar is located in the eastern part of Ethiopia, 525 km from the capital of Addis Ababa, on a plateau with deep gorges surrounded by deserts and savannah. The walls surrounding this sacred city, considered \u201cthe fourth holy city\u201d of Islam, were built between the 13th and 16th centuries and served as a protective barrier. There were five historic gates, which corresponded to the main roads to the town and also served to divide the city into five neighbourhoods, but this division is not functional anymore. The Harar gate, from where the main streets lead to the centre, is of recent construction.\nHarar Jugol numbers 82 mosques, three of which date from the 10th century, 102 shrines and a number of traditional, Indian and combined townhouses with unique interior designs, which constitute a spectacular part of Harar&apos;s cultural heritage. The African and Islamic traditions influenced over a long period of time the development of the city and its typical urban planning and contributed to its particular character and uniqueness. The present urban layout follows the 16th century design for an Islamic town with its central core occupied with commercial and religious buildings and a maze of narrow alleyways with imposing facades. The traditional Harari house has a typical, specific and original architectural form, different from the domestic layout usually known in Muslim countries, although reminiscent of the coastal Arab architecture, and with an exceptional interior design. At the end of the 19thcentury Indian merchants built new houses with wooden verandas that defined a different urban landscape and influenced the construction of the combined Indian/Harari houses. Their architectural and ornamental qualities are now part of the Harari cultural heritage.\u00a0\nHarar functioned as the capital of the Harari Kingdom from 1520 to 1568, became an independent emirate in the 17th century and was integrated into Ethiopia in 1887. From the late 16th century to the 19th century Harar was an important trade centre between the coast and the interior highlands and a location for Islamic learning.\nToday Harar is the administrative capital of the Harari People National Regional State (HPNRS). The historic town has a traditionally functioning community, forming a complex social-environmental whole where each element has its symbolic and practical significance. The Harari people are distinguished by the continued cultural traditions and quality of their handicrafts, including weaving, basket making and book binding. The organization of the communities through traditional systems has preserved its social and physical inheritance and, significantly, the Harari language.\n\u00a0\nCriterion (ii): The historic town of Harar Jugol exhibits an important interchange of values of original Islamic culture, expressed in the social and cultural development of the city enclosed within the otherwise Christian region. Such influences have been merged with traditions that relate to the inland of Africa and particularly to southern Ethiopia, giving a particular characteristic form to its architecture and urban plan.\nCriterion (iii): Harar Jugol bears exceptional testimony to cultural traditions related to Islamic and African roots. It is considered \u201cthe fourth holy city\u201d of Islam, having been developed by a holy missionary from the Arabic Peninsula. Though a trading place and thus a melting pot of various influences, Harar has been in relative isolation in its region, contributing to a cultural specificity, expressed in its characteristic community structure and traditions, which are still alive.\nCriterion (iv): Harar Jugol is an outstanding example of a type of architectural and urban ensemble which illustrates the impact of African and Islamic traditions on the development of specific building types. The building types and the entire urban layout reflect these traditions, which give a particular character and even uniqueness to Harar Jugol.\nCriterion (v): Harar Jugol with its surrounding landscape is an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement, representative of cultural interaction with the environment. The social and spatial structure (afocha) and the language of the people all reflect a particular and even unique relationship that there developed with the environment. The cultural and physical relationships with the territory have survived till today, but they are also vulnerable to irreversible change under the impact of the modern globalizing world.&quot;, &quot;Authenticity&quot;: &quot;Harar Jugol is a rare example of a relatively well preserved historic town that has retained its traditions, urban fabric, and rich Harari Muslim cultural heritage to the present time. It is one of the holy towns of Islam in Africa, and the capital of a minority region within Christian Ethiopia. The historic city is physically limited and well defined by its 16th century surrounding wall and the setting has been retained along the eastern and south-eastern sides of the property. However, inappropriate interventions, such as plastering the houses, changing doors from wood to metal, the introduction of non-traditional materials and visual impacts such as TV antennas have been gradually affecting the authenticity of the historic fabric. Guidelines for interventions need to be enforced and communicated amongst the inhabitants to prevent further impacts on the authenticity of the property.&quot;, &quot;Integrity&quot;: &quot;The inscribed property of Harar Jugol has a core zone of 48 ha which encompass the entire walled city and contains all the attributes that sustain the Outstanding Universal Value of the property. The buffer zone extends 800m to the south and 1700m to the east whilst, on the west side, it is narrow and confined by the new town of Harar. Urban encroachment, on the western edge of the walled town, is the current concern.\nAlthough there have been some urban development towards the west and north parts, the historic city remains intact on the eastern and south-eastern part of the walled town where the essential relationship between the urban and rural areas is still maintained.\nExcept for some changes that took place in the 19th and 20th centuries, such as the replacement of the principal Mosque by the Orthodox Church, and the enlargement of the main street leading from the western gate, the historic city has kept its traditional housing reasonably intact.\nHowever, the integrity of the property can be threatened by emerging trends to alter and modernize the traditional buildings, which would make them susceptible to irreversible change. Careful monitoring, enforcement of regulations, raising awareness and the promotion of preservation attitudes amongst the inhabitants are actions needed to maintain integrity.&quot;, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: &quot;Harar has been officially registered as an Ethiopian National Heritage site since 1974. The legislative framework which protects the property includes the \u201cHeritage Conservation Draft Proclamation of Harari People National Regional State\u201d (January 2000), \&quot;The Establishment of Harar Heritage Conservation Office\&quot; (Proclamation no. 21/1992) and the Federal Proclamation no. 209/2000 for \u201cResearch and Conservation of Cultural Heritage\u201d. In addition, four levels of protection have been identified for the property within the Management Plan: principal monuments, important historic buildings, contextual urban fabric and \u2018out-of-context\u2019 buildings.\nThe Centre for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage (ARCCH), established in 1976, is responsible for the inventory and the definition of conservation policies, providing support for restoration work, and making decisions over grants and permits. The local authority and the Kebele act as administrative offices in the process. The Jugol Heritage Conservation Office (JHCO), established in 2003, has a management committee and serves as a liaison between the Harari Counsel, under the General Meeting of the Harari People National Regional State, and representatives of the administrative and social structure in Jugol. The main source of funding comes from the government. However, there has been cooperation between the local authority, the Urban Development Support Service, and the German Technical Organization.\nThe Urban Master Plan and the GIS system that inventories historic structures are tools to drive decision-making at the property. The Master Plan has the main objectives of preserving historic heritage, improving living conditions for the inhabitants and the promotion of tourism in addition to the conservation of the agricultural landscape in the buffer zone. Factors that need to be addressed through management and conservation actions include the enforcement of regulations for new constructions, infrastructure development, waste management, the maintenance and conservation of historic buildings as well as the preservation of the setting. The management of Harar Jugol will need to address the challenges faced to achieve the delicate balance between the need for conservation of cultural heritage and traditional values with those for the improvement of quality of life and sustainable development.&quot;}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>

        <untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>{&quot;Brief synthesis&quot;: &quot;In a mountainous region in the heart of Ethiopia, some 645 km from Addis Ababa, eleven medieval monolithic churches were carved out of rock. Their building is attributed to King Lalibela who set out to construct in the 12th century a \u2018New Jerusalem\u2019, after Muslim conquests halted Christian pilgrimages to the holy Land. Lalibela flourished after the decline of the Aksum Empire.\nThere are two main groups of churches \u2013 to the north of the river Jordan: Biete Medhani Alem\u00a0 (House of the Saviour of the World), Biete\u00a0 Mariam (House of Mary), Biete\u00a0 Maskal (House of the Cross), Biete Denagel (House of Virgins), Biete Golgotha Mikael (House of Golgotha Mikael); and to the south of the river, Biete Amanuel (House of Emmanuel), Biete Qeddus Mercoreus (House of St. Mercoreos), Biete Abba Libanos (House of Abbot Libanos), Biete Gabriel Raphael (House of Gabriel Raphael), and Biete Lehem (House of Holy Bread). The eleventh church, Biete Ghiorgis (House of St. George), is isolated from the others, but connected by a system of trenches.\nThe churches were not constructed in a traditional way but rather were hewn from the living rock of monolithic blocks. These blocks were further chiselled out, forming doors, windows, columns, various floors, roofs etc. This gigantic work was further completed with an extensive system of drainage ditches, trenches and ceremonial passages, some with openings to hermit caves and catacombs.\nBiete Medhani Alem, with its five aisles, is believed to be the largest monolithic church in the world, while Biete Ghiorgis has a remarkable cruciform plan. Most were probably used as churches from the outset, but Biete Mercoreos and Biete Gabriel Rafael may formerly have been royal residences. Several of the interiors are decorated with mural paintings.\nNear the churches, the village of Lalibela has two storey round houses, constructed of local red stone, and known as the Lasta Tukuls. These exceptional churches have been the focus of pilgrimage for Coptic Christians since the 12th century.\nCriterion (i): All the eleven churches represent a unique artistic achievement, in their execution, size and the variety and boldness of their form.\nCriterion (ii): The King of Lalibela set out to build a symbol of the holy land, when pilgrimages to it were rendered impossible by the historical situation. In the Church of Biet Golgotha, are replicas of the tomb of Christ, and of Adam, and the crib of the Nativity. The holy city of Lalibela became a substitute for the holy places of Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and as such has had considerable influence on Ethiopian Christianity.\nCriterion (iii): The whole of Lalibela offers an exceptional testimony to the medieval and post-medieval civilization of Ethiopia, including, next to the eleven churches, the extensive remains of traditional, two storey circular village houses with interior staircases and thatched roofs.&quot;, &quot;Authenticity&quot;: &quot;The Rock-Hewn Churches of Lalibela are still preserved in their natural settings. The association of the rock-hewn churches and the traditional vernacular circular houses, in the surrounding area, still demonstrate evidences of the ancient village layout. The original function of the site as a pilgrimage place still persists and provides evidence of the continuity of social practices. The intangible heritages associated with church practices are still preserved.&quot;, &quot;Integrity&quot;: &quot;The drainage ditches were filled up with earth for several centuries, before being cleared in the 20th century, and have been disrupted by seismic activity. This has resulted in a severe degradation of the monuments from water damage, and most of them are now considered to be in a critical condition.\nStructural problems have been identified in Biet Amanuel where an imminent risk of collapse is possible, and other locations need to be monitored. Serious degradation of the paintings inside the churches has occurred over the last thirty years. Sculptures and bas-reliefs (such as at the entrance of Biet Mariam) have also been severely damaged, and their original features are hardly recognisable. All of this threatens the integrity of the property.\nTemporary light-weight shelters have now been installed over some churches and these, while offering protection, impact on visual integrity.\nOther threats include encroachment on the environment of the churches by new public and private construction, housing associated with the traditional village adjacent to the property, and from the infrastructure of tourism.&quot;, &quot;Protection and management requirements&quot;: &quot;For centuries, the Church and State have been jointly responsible for the holy site of Lalibela. Home to a large community of priests and monks, it is a living site which draws many pilgrims to celebrate the great feasts of the Ethiopian Christian calendar. This active and energetic perspective is central to the management of the site.\nNo special legal framework is provided to protect the Rock-Hewn Churches except the general law, Proclamation No. 209/2000, which has also established the institution in charge, the Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage (ARCCH). With the Ethiopian Church as a partner, the ARCCH has a representative in Lalibela but a principle difficulty has been the harmonization of the different projects and effective coordination between the partners.\nThe property is administered under the regional and the Lasta district culture and tourism office. To prevent the property from the impact of development, a draft proclamation has been prepared but this is not yet ratified. A management plan has not yet been established. A four year Conservation Plan was established in 2006 but this has yet to be fully implemented.\nThe boundary for the property has not yet been clearly delineated and a buffer zone has not yet been provided.\nThere is a need for stronger planning controls for the setting of the churches that address housing, land-use tourism and for a management plan to be developed that integrates the Conservation action plan, and addresses the overall sustainable development of the area, with the involvement of the local population.&quot;}</untitled-ontology-5:TotalDescription>
